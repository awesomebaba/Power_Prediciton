# Power_Prediction_Model (VidyutKavach)

## Design of CYBER-SECURITY ENABLED SMART CONTROLLER for grid-connected Microgrid

The Power Prediction Model is an integral component of the **VidyutKavach solution**, designed to ensure the seamless operation and security of microgrid infrastructure. This model uses real-time power data to predict upcoming power levels and ensures proactive management of power fluctuations. If the predicted power readings exceed predefined safety thresholds, the system automatically generates a flag to trigger a controlled shutdown, preventing system failures or damage.
 

 ## Features

 The model uses the following input features to make its predictions:

#### -Global_active_power

#### -Global_reactive_power

#### -Voltage

#### -Global_intensity

#### -Sub_metering_1

#### -Sub_metering_2

#### -Sub_metering_3

## Functionality

The model forecasts the power readings for the next 5 minutes. If the predicted values exceed the safety limit, a flag is generated, prompting immediate power cut-off. This ensures better security, protection against system failures, and prevention of potential hardware damage due to power overloads.

## Purpose

The Power Prediction Model enhances the overall security of microgrid systems by integrating machine learning with real-time monitoring and predictive capabilities, safeguarding against unexpected power surges and system vulnerabilities.
